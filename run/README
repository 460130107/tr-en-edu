To install the libraries and preprocess data, just execute make with available cores:
	make CORES=8
	
You should create new directory for an experiment and prepare the config file. After
that, you can start a experiment by executing run-experiment.sh with experiment directory:
	./run-experiment.sh {experiment-directory}
